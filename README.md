# Bayesian inference

Bayesian inference is a way of getting unknown quantities given known facts.   
The method uses probability to describe uncertainty as to what the values of the unknown quantities could potentialy be.  
Bayesian data analysis is the use of bayesian inference to learn from data, the known facts, and the unknown quantities we want to learn are the values of parameters or what future data might look like.  

     | The role of probability distributions in Bayesian data analysis is to represent uncertainty, and the role of Bayesian inference is to update probability            distributions to reflect what has been learned from data.  

Why Bayesian approach?
  * Works well for noisy data and small sample data.
  * The interpretations of the models are straightforward, as such, intuitive.
  
One of the most distinguishing features of the bayesian models is that they return a set of plausible values for each parameter, whereas, the frequentist approach (linear regression for example) gives a single value for each effect of the model, and not a distribution of values. 

Two terms used in Bayesian inference: 
  * Prior: a probability distribution that represents what the model knows before seeing the data.   
  * posterior: is a probability distribution that represents what the model knows after having seen the data.
